# Using Pygame to make pretty pictures!

So, i thought, hey i did this same thing in 3 other languages/modules, lets do it for real!

That was my first mistake


So after a week of dicking around with python i made a (almost funtional) raytraced lighting system, if you try it out now
you will see these annoying ass scan lines, i couldnt be bothered to work on it anymore, so i kinda just left it like this.

this whole project is the definition of tech debt.
